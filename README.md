# About The Project
JD Gym is a low cost gym chain in the UK which has a mobile app but lacks functionality. I worked with a UI designer, and together we have created an app redesign to help improve the user experience allowing them to book classes and navigate the app easily. Please click this <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/c92821ad-effa-4615-7d60-534c34857019-bf19/">link</a> for the UI design.

STATUS: The app's functionality is currently limited but the overall UI design is complete.

### Built With
