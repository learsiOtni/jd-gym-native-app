# About The Project
JD Gym is a low cost gym chain in the UK which has a mobile app but lacks functionality. I worked with a UI designer, and together we have created an app redesign to help improve the user experience allowing them to book classes and navigate the app easily.

Please find the link bellow to the UI design:

### Status
The app's functionality is currently limited but the overall UI design is complete.
